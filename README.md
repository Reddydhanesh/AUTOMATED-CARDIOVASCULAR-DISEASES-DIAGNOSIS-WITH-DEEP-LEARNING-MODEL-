# AUTOMATED-CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASES-DIAGNOSIS-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING-MODEL-
This project focuses on the automated diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) using deep learning techniques. We trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on ECG image datasets consisting of multiple heart conditions and deployed the model using Flask for easy accessibility.
